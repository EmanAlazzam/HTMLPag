    Early stachyurus or stachyurus praecox is a recipient of Award of Garden Merit and is probably one of the most beautiful flowers of winter.
    After the tree loses it leaves at the start of the season, strings of tiny round yellow-green florets hang in rows by the end of the bare spindly branches. This floral display is mesmerizing to look at as the flowers dance with the cool winter breeze.
    Early stachyurus is easy to grow. It may require rich, well-drained soil and full sun but once established, the plant will survive with little maintenance.
