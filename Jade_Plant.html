            No one can go wrong in choosing a jade plant (Crassula ovata) as a house plant. 
            It is a succulent that stores water in its thick leaves so watering is only required when the soil feels dry to the touch. 
            It also likes plenty of sunlight and when the right conditions are met, jade plants will reward with beautiful bunches of tiny white or pink flowers.
            Jade plants are considered lucky by the Chinese. 
            Planting them in porcelain containers indoors is said to bring good financial luck. 
            They are also edible, some African tribes feed on the roots and leaves and sometimes use them in treating mild illnesses too.<img align="right"src="https://florgeous.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fragrant-daphne.jpg"Style height="300px">
