    Arabis alpina or alpine rock cress is a species that bloom in winter. Its use in landscapes is often described as minimalistic because of the simple white flowers blooming on top of a slender stalk and small leaves.
    In the wild, alpine rock cresses spread along riverbanks and damp gravel. Aside from moist soils, this plant does not need a lot to thrive.
    It can grow in full sun or shade and fertile or acidic soil. However, wet conditions often entail pathogens so the plant is subject to rusts and mildews.
