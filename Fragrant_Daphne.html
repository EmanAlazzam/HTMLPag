            The scented flowers of Daphne odorata are known to decorate the chilly winter. 
            The sometimes variegated glossy dark green leaves surround the ball of often four-petaled pink and purple flowers. 
            The evergreen shrub has many uses in the garden such as hedge, foundation, border, etc.
            Fragrant daphnes are quite difficult to establish.
             They prefer cool well-drained soil and are easily affected by virus diseases. They are slow-growers too but can eventually reach more than a meter high. 
             All parts of the plant are poisonous so better grow them away from childrenâ€™s reach.
