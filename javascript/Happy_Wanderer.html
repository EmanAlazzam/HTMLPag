            A playful climbing shrub, happy wanderer lives up to its name. 
            It grows in almost all kinds of soil and sun conditions but of course blooms best with lots of sunlight. 
            The plant serves lots of roles in the garden, from mass planting to mixed bed to fence cover to trellis climbers. 
            The purple and white flowers never fail to amaze garden visitors. Indigenous many regions of South Australia, happy wanderer or Hardenbergia violacea is a precious plant species. 
            It has a symbiotic relationship with root nodule-forming bacteria that fixes nitrogen in the atmosphere. This fixation benefits not just the plant itself but the surrounding flora as well. 
            The leaves and roots are edible too and they make a refreshingly sweet drink.
